| Project Team Name | Remember Me |
| Project Name | Remember Me |
| Event Track | Digital Trust Ideation |
 
## Use Case Abstract

When a user forgets their account information, they need to go through the reset flow, which can be very time consuming and not something that makes our customers happy. If the user has set up a digital driver's license with their DMV and has it saved to their digital wallet, they can reset their account more easily.
